        <p>
          Luke Moroney is a poetry and short-fiction writer living in Naarm (Melbourne), 
          Australia. He has previously appeared in Antithesis Journal (University of 
          Melbourne), and Poetic Portraits anthology (RMIT). Luke is currently in his 
          final year of a Bachelor of Arts (Creative Writing) at RMIT. His work engages 
          with the concept of embodiment through place-based methods and ideas of human/
          non-human co-habitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          His latest work, Insomnomania (2025), explores memory 
          and unreality through author-reader interactivity using the Twine digital 
          interface. Lukeâ€™s background in Youth Work and experiences living in Frankston 
          North informs his anti-classist methodologies.
